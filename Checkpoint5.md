**Back-test optimized portfolio to determine viability**

..................................................................................
This component of the project is an extension of part 4 in that portfolio optimization backtesting results from part 4's portfolio construction. From the optimized portfolios from each year's of analysis starting in 1987 and endig 2017, we show through backtesting the feasability of agnostic fundamental analysis in constructing portfolios to exploit the reversion of mispriced assets. In particular, this backtesting selects the most extreme quartiles of assets in expected overperformance and underperformance to allow for more targeted reversion alpha-taking.

Through similar tools as other backtesting platforms such as Quantopian, we are able to analyze the performance of our portfolio from a holistic standpoint. In particular, the key performance variables that we care about are alpha, beta, sharpe, and maximum drawdown.
