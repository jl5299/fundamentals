**Implement Variance Covariance Matrix (Factor Model Construction)**

..................................................................................

This part of the project was completely new in terms of the data required, so I had to start from scratch again in terms of compiling, cleaning, and normalizing the datasets we needed. Beyond the getting and cleaning of data, however, Professor Gillen's guidance again helped a lot in terms of analyzing the dataset on MATLAB.

Factor model construction requires two components: benchmarks for factors by month, and returns on which the factors are analyzed upon. Taking these two together, the variance covariance matrix describes our posterior results in a manner to allow combined analysis with our prior fundamnetal data. Ultimatley, this step helps us connect two things - market cap residuals from part 1 and 2's fundamental analysis and the reversion of said market cap residuals to regular levels through factor analysis. Completion of this step means that I now have both ends of the experiment's hypothesis to combine into steps 4 and 5 to determine whether or not agnostic fundamental factors determine market cap.
