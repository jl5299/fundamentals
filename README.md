**Bartram/Grinblatt** - 310 return months (Friday Feb 27, march 1987 - Friday Nov 30, december 2012)
**Gillen/Law** - 360 return months 1987 - 2017

**CRSP DATA QUERIES AND SPECIFICATIONS**
**CRSP Monthly Price Data:** "Shares outstanding, price, return" - CRSP Monthly Stock
- Share Price
- Number of shares outstanding
**CRSP Returns Data:** "Returns, Beta" - CRSP Beta Suite by WRDS (Beta)
- Ticker Symbol

- Annual market beta 
- All stocks listed in NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ

The data we had access to didn't specify the share classes, differing in procedure from Bartram Grinblatt -- they took only common euqity share classes of US corporations (10 and 11). Ignoring this specification should be alright - majority of stocks that are listed in NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX should provide the same results.
